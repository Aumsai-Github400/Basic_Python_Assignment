    "**1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function is block of code which run only when it is called. Function are built to enhance reusability of cade without writing same code for same task. Functions make program shorter and increase code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Code as below (Example)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \n",
    "            \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "            statement(s)\n",

    "     function_name()\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFunction is run when it called in program, not when its specified or defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What statement creates a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\tTo create function in python language there is keyword or statement called “def”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFunction is block of code consist of def statement and instruction to perform or execute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*    **Function call:**\n",
    "\t\n",
    "        Function can be executed only when it called. Function call is what, which move interpreter or executor inside function to perform task or to take action as defined in form of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are four scope in python programming such as Built-in scope, Global scope, Non-Local or Enclosing scope and at the last Local scope.\n",
    "- Whatever variable defined outside a function is in Global scope of that function, and whatever variable defined inside function is in local scope of that function.\n",
    "- By default there is one global scope and local scope is whenever function is created and called.\n",
    "- To find how many global scope is there we can use function called globals().\n",
    "- To find how many local scope is there we can use function called locals().\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When function terminated or interpreter call return then local variable get destroyed or not remembered by interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Code as below (Example)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Def square(x):\n",
    "        Y = x*x\n",
    "        Return (y)\n",
    "    Z = square (10)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print (y)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In above example variable y is in local scope of function square, when interpreter calls return interpreter start to execute next code by leaving function. Hence error occurred when variable y call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The return statement is used to exit function and go back to the place where function called and execute rest code if exist. Any value can be return by function, return value can be use as part of expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A function without return statement returns value “None”.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If function want to refer variable and variable is not exist in local scope of function by default function check for global variable and refer if found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Code as below (Example)**\n",

    "    15 (After execution result is)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To modify global variable from function variable we need to use keyword called global.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Code as below (Example)**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Place that code that might cause error into try block.\n",

    "**14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In python error can be categories into two errors I.e.  syntax error and exception error. Errors tend to stop execution of program. To handle such problem in python there are two blocks named as Try block and handle block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Try Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try block use to check error in code, code that can potentially cause error will go inside try code. If error comes or happen try block will skip code and go for next code to execute\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Except Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Except black use to handle error, whatever error cause into try block can be handle with the help of except block. And will execute rest code without exiting from code.\n"
