    "**1. In the Below Elements Which of Them Are Values or An Expression? Eg:- Values Can Be Integer Or String And Expressions Will Be Mathematical Operators.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **String**\n",
    "- String is datatype class in python. String content can be enclosed by single (‘  ‘) or double quotes (“  “). \n",
    "- Backslash use to escape work. String content inside triple quote (“””   “””) use for multiple line of string.\n",
    "- We can parse string with the help of string slicing functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variables**\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Variables are noting but container which contain or store values, expression, strings etc. \n",
    "- Variable can be assigned for strings.\n",
    "    Eg. \n",
    "    a = ‘Hello Word!’\n",
    "- Reusability of specific value, expression, or strings enhanced due to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Describe Three Different Data Types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **1.\tList : [  ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "    List is an ordered sequence of items. It can hold integer, float , complex number and strings too. Its very flexible data type. Content or data store in list by enclosing into square bracket [   ]. In python we can enclose list inside list , and its possible to make blank list too.\n",
    "    List can be parse by using list slicing method. In list slicing index start from 0 to till end however lower bound is considered in string and upper bound is excluding.\n",
    "    List have their own built-in functions such as sort, append, insert, extend remove, reverse and many more ..\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "    L1 =                     [ 1 ,55, 70, 605, 71, 87, 10]\n",
    "    \n",
    "*    **2.\tDictionary: {  }**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dictionary is ordered collection of data in python which follows key and value pair functionality. Data or content stored in dictionary by enclosed them into two curly brackets. {  }. We can assign any datatype inside dictionary. Dictionary slicing can be done by parsing key and values. \n",
    "    To convert data (which is in key and value pair format) into dictionary there is one built in function called ‘Dict( )’.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "    dict1 = {\"Name\":'Aumsai', 'Course':'Full stack data science', 'Email_ID':'aumsaiw84@gmail.com'}\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "*    **3.Strings: (‘ ’)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strings are object that contain sequence of character of data. Data store or content in string by enclosed in single quote (‘ ’) or double quote (“ ”). We can perform string slicing by parsing through indexes. For strings index start from 0 to till end. While slicing lower bound is included and upper bound is excluded one. We can assign variable for string to enhance reusability of code or string. \n",
    "    In string operator ‘+’ will use to concatenate string with other string but we try concatenation for string and integer its not possible. For operator * string will be multiplying into number of times equal to given integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: 'Hello World!'\n",

    "**4.What Is an Expression Made Up Of? What Do All Expressions Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expression is combination of operator and operand. Expression in python evaluate the data or values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: 5 + 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example 5 and 1 are operand and + is Arithmetic operator. \n",
    "    \n",
    "  This combination will evaluate result into 6. This called expression in python.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. This Assignment Statements, Like Spam = 10. What Is The Difference Between An Expression And A Statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In assignment statement spam = 10, Spam is nothing but variable and with assigned value 10 .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instruction written in code for execution is nothing but statement. There are multiple types of statement in python such as Assignment statement, looping statement and conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expression is combination of operator and operand. Expression in python evaluate data. There are many types of Expression such as constant expression, floating expression logical expression etc.\n",

    "**6. After Running The Following Code, What Does The Variable Bacon Contain?**\n",
    "    Bacon = 22\n",
    "    Bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Bacon = 22**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bacon is variable with value 22. \n",
    "\n",
    "*    **Bacon + 1** \n",
    "(After execution result is 23)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bacon variable is still have value 22, new result (23) is not assigned to any variable yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What should the values of the following two terms be?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Spam' + 'Spamspam'\n",
    "- 'Spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anwer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are concatenating ‘Spam’ + ‘Spamspam’ string with another string result into ‘SpamSpamspam’\n",
    "- In second String is multiply by integer ‘Spam’*3 result into ‘SpamSpamSpam’\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Int(), float  and str() these three built in function can be used for typecasting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- 'I Have Eaten ' + 99 + ' Burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concatenation can be possible for string with other string not with the combination of string and integer.\n",
    "- To fix this issue, we can put 99 into single (' ') or double (\" \") quote to typecast into string.\n"
